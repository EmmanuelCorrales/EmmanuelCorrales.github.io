      <span class="post-date">Oct 11, 2019</span>
      <p>I decided to write this post because I’ve been getting a lot of tickets
regarding pipelines not working due to improper removal of git submodule/s in
their repo. Here’s a simple guide on how to remove Git submodules.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Jul 29, 2019</span>
      <p>Lately I’ve been getting a lot of issues regarding self-signed certificates with
Java apps using Gradle as their build tool. The issues were mostly errors like
<em>“Exception in thread “main” javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException”</em> or packages
that can’t be downloaded because of an invalid certificate. This was caused by
Gradle not importing the corporate certificiate pre-installed on my client’s
company issued laptop by default. This post is a guide about using a self signed
certificate with Gradle.</p>

      <p>I was setting up a CentOS 7 virtual machine using VirtualBox to replicate an
existing setup when I discovered that I cannot access the internet even though
my VM was setup to use a <strong>bridged adapter</strong>.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Apr 30, 2019</span>
      <p>This past month I’ve been bombarded with lots of issues regarding HTTPS/SSL.
The internal Certificate Authority of the company I’m servicing recently changed
their root certicate. This caused the services that communicate with other
services in their network through HTTPS/SSL to break and receive errors. I’ve
been debugging a NodeJS app that is being plagued by these issues. In this post
I’ll show you the steps I took to fix this.</p>

      </div>
      <span class="post-date">Feb 24, 2019</span>
      <p>I recently learned the proper way to debug shell scripts. It seems shell
scripting has built-in features that can help developers find problems in their
script. In this post I will be sharing how I debug scripts before and what is
wrong with it while also showing the proper way to do it.</p>
