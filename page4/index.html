      <p>Rails by default uses a numeric id as a parameter for its URL. Sometimes when
building a website such as this blog, instead of <b>emmanuelcorrales.com/blog/4</b>
we want the url to be more SEO and user friendly like
<b>emmanuelcorrales.com/blog/seo-and-user-friendly-urls-for-rails-with-friendlyid</b>.
We can achieve this by using the <a href="https://github.com/norman/friendly_id">FriendlyID</a>
gem. In this tutorial I'll show you how to use <a href="https://github.com/norman/friendly_id">FriendlyID</a>.</p>

        </a>
      </div>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 9, 2017</span>
      <p>While searching for ways to upload images to Amazon S3 on Rails, I stumbled
upon two gems that simplifies this task,
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave">Carrierwave</a>.
I tried <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> first and
made an article about it <a href="http://emmanuelcorrales.com/posts/upload-images-to-amazon-s3-with-paperclip-on-rails">here</a>.
A senior colleague of mine recommended
<a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave">Carrierwave</a>, so
I tried to give it a shot and it was worth it.
It is much cleaner to implement because it requires the user to create a helper class for uploading.
The model just needs to mount the helper class. This separates the code for uploading unlike on <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> where the code for uploading is included in the model and requires the user to create a migration.</p>


    
      <div class="post-title">
        <a class="title-link" href="/blog/upload-images-to-amazon-s3-with-paperclip-on-rails">
          <h2 class="post-title">Upload images to Amazon S3 with Paperclip on Rails</h2>
        </a>
      </div>
      <span class="post-date">Dec 3, 2016</span>
      <p>Sometimes uploading files to your server's local filesystem is not enough due
to some constraints like a limited disk space and potential security issues caused
by allowing users to upload files to your server. Using third party services like
Amazon S3 for file storage is a good way to solve these issues. I decided to use the
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a> gem to implement
this functionality on my Rails app.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Building a mock location app for Android.</h2>
        </a>
      </div>
      <span class="post-date">Sep 2, 2016</span>
      <p>Recently I've been asked to test the android app I'm developing for my client.
The app is called SurveyBods and owned by the company called Researchbods and it is only available in the UK.
A notification shows up whenever the user enters a place which is represented by a geofence.
The notification would prompt the user with a survey or a quick poll.
My problem with this is that I'm not allowed to get out of my office and using DDMS is a very tedious task so I decided to make a mock location app to make it more exciting for me.</p>
