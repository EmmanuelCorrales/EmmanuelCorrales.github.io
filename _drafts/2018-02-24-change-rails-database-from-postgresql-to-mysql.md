<p>My preferred database for developing Ruby on Rails application has always been
PostgreSQL but unfortunately I've recently been using Ubuntu on WSL which has issues with it.
I can install Postgresql on Windows but that would be tedious and dirty for me.
I prefer to just use Windows for games and not for software development.
I decided to just use MySQL instead of PostgresSQL.</p>
